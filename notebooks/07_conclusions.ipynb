    "### For Utility Companies\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement rolling fire activity monitoring**\n",
    "   - Track 7-day and 30-day cumulative fire metrics\n",
    "   - Use satellite-based FRP data for real-time monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deploy predictive models for resource allocation**\n",
    "   - Use Random Forest/Gradient Boosting classifiers for severity prediction\n",
    "   - Pre-position crews during high-risk periods\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Seasonal preparedness planning**\n",
    "   - Enhanced readiness for June-November (fire season)\n",
    "   - Maintain winter storm response capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Future Research\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expand dataset**\n",
    "   - Include more recent data (2017-present)\n",
    "   - Add weather variables (wind speed, humidity, temperature)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Geographic granularity**\n",
    "   - Analysis at county or utility service area level\n",
    "   - Incorporate transmission line proximity to fire zones\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced modeling**\n",
    "   - Deep learning for temporal patterns\n",
    "   - Spatial-temporal models incorporating geography"
